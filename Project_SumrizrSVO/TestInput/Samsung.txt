New Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge factory opens to meet rising demand
According to Bloomberg, the new production line – thoughtfully dubbed ‘A3’ – will enable Samsung to more than double its monthly output.
This means Samsung will be able to produce some 5 million screens each month, up from a current 2 million.
The sources cited are purported to have ‘direct knowledge of the matter’, but asked not to be identified ‘as the matter is private’.
The company previously hoped to utilise the new factory starting in June, however it moved the schedule forward to meet demand.
While we don’t know exact figures, it’s widely claimed that the Galaxy S6 Edge demand has outstripped Samsung’s initial expectations for the device.
