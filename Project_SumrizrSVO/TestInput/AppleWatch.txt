Apple Watch makes the worst thing about the iPhone 6 even worse.
Apple’s latest iPhones are, without question, the company’s most impressive iPhones to date. The iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus both feature sleek designs, stunning screens and shockingly strong performance that manages to crush most rival smartphones despite Apple’s decision to stick with a dual-core chipset and 1GB of RAM.
But there is one area where the smaller iPhone model in particular definitely lags behind much of the competition, and it looks like the problem is being exacerbated by the brand new Apple Watch.
Since the iPhone 6 was first released back in September last year, people have had one major complaint: battery life. While many other smartphone makers were focused on extending battery life through optimizations and even by stuffing larger batteries into their phones, Apple instead chose to focus on slimming down its iPhone to just 6.9mm.
The iPhone 6 looks and feels fantastic, but many users argued that they would have preferred a larger battery to a slimmer iPhone.
