Clinton Foundation Admits 'Mistakes' in US Tax Filing
The Clinton Foundation is acknowledging that it made "mistakes" in its financial reports on the donations made by foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.  The matter has threatened to become a political problem in the early days of her campaign for president.
In a statement Sunday, acting chief executive Maura Pally said the foundation "will likely" have to refile its U.S. tax returns for several years after a review of its donations is completed. She said the foundation's total revenue on the tax forms was accurate, but that it had mistakenly lumped in the foreign donations with other contributions even as it had disclosed the information on the foundation's web site.
Political critics have questioned the Clinton Foundation's transparency, citing the possibility of conflicts of interest with her actions as the country's top diplomat from 2009 to early 2013. Pally said the foundation, whose anti-poverty and health care initiatives stretch throughout the world, is committed to transparency in its disclosure of donations.
